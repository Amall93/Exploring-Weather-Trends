# Exploring-Weather-Trends
## Summary
Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

## Instructions 
The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

## The Database Schema
  There are three tables in the database:
  
   •	city_list   - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database.
    
   •	city_data   - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
    
   •	global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).


## steps 
   • Extract the data from the database using SQL query.
   • Open up the CSV in Excel.
   • Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures.
   • Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall            trends.
   
## Submission   
   Project submission should be a PDF that includes an outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
   
   •	What tools did you use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
   •	How did you calculate the moving average?
   •	What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
